# Overview
This project performs network analysis on economic datasets to understand the structure and dynamics within economic networks. By applying various centrality measures and community detection algorithms, we uncover key insights about influential nodes, pathways, and community structures. This analysis can provide valuable information for policymakers, researchers, and business analysts working with complex economic systems.
# Project Objective
The primary objective is to analyze the economic network using different centralities and community detection algorithms. 
We aim to:
- Identify influential nodes and their roles in the network.
- Detect community structures within the network.
- Gain insights into the economic interactions and interdependencies across regions or entities.
# Dataset
We analyzed four economic network datasets, each representing different economic entities or interactions:
- econ-wm1.txt
- econ-wm3.txt
- econ-beause.txt
- econ-becxc.txt

Each dataset contains nodes representing countries or regions and edges representing economic interactions.

# Methodology
Our approach involved:
### Centrality Measures
Calculating measures like betweenness, degree, closeness, and eigenvector centrality to identify influential nodes.
### Community Detection Algorithms
Using algorithms such as Louvain, Girvan-Newman, and Kernighan-Lin to identify community structures within the networks.
# Results
Our findings highlighted several key aspects:
- Certain nodes are highly influential across the network, acting as major hubs or key economic entities.
- Community detection revealed modular structures within the network, suggesting interconnected groups of entities with higher interaction rates among themselves.
- Among the datasets, econ-wm3 exhibited the strongest community structure with the highest modularity value.
